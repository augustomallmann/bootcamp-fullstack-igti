This repository contains all the projects developed during the Bootcamp which <strong>I was granted a 100% scholarship</strong>. The codes are not copies of the professor but challenges developed by me to achieve the requirements of each section. 

The main objective of this Bootcamp is to <strong>prepare jr developers to face and solve real problems using</strong> the most modern programming languages such as <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>.
